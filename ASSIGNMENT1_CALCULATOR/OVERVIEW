BASIC CALCULATOR APP

The calculator is styled using CSS grid
The screen portion is a single input tag with a class and an ID. The class is for styling and the ID is used for accessing the element in JavaScript
Each button has a class of either 'symbol' or 'number', which are used for styling purposes
Each button also has an onclick function assigned to it
The wipe() function is used to clear the display by resetting the value of the input tag to an empty string
The show() function is used to type the corresponding value of the clicked button (represented as n in js file) into the input tag
The calc() function evaluates the value of the input tag and does the actual calculations
